      The polar bear is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, 
      encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. 
      It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore.
	  The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat.
	  It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump.
	  Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat.
	  The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.
